### How it all started...

Well, first things first...

After using Linux for many years now I got used to the tool called YaKuake. It's a quake-like console that can be set to start upon logging in and to be scrolled down and hidden just by pressing F12. This proved to be very useful tool that I practically got hooked on. Now, beeing sometimes (well, most of the times lately) forced to use Windows I've been trying to find something similar to this, and then I bumped into <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/%22Drop-Down%22%2c-Quake-style-command-prompt-for-Window/" target="_blank">this</a> and by using the instructions and tools provided there I managed to fix up this little thingie I called "Quake-style Terminal for Windows" (not quite intuitive, I have to admit, but couldn't come up with anything better at the time).

Anyway, to make a long story short, I hope you'll like this and, most importantly, find it useful.
