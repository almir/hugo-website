This is meant to be the home page for my recent project Robust File Copy Front End, or RFCFE.

This project arised from my extensive use of the robocopy command on Windows and wish to develop something using C# (even though I'm not really a developer). I know there already is a robocopy front end from TechNet, which is free, and even one (or more of them) that should be payed for, but I guessed one more won't hurt, especially since this one is completely open sourced and GPL'd. As I already mentioned this application was developed using C# programming language and hence it requires the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=0856EACB-4362-4B0D-8EDD-AAB15C5E04F5&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Microsoft .NET Framework 2</a> to run.<br>
The application also requires you to have robocopy installed and configured in your system path, which should already be done if you're using Windows Vista, 7, Server 2008 or Server 2008 R2. For older versions of Windows robocopy was installed as a part of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=9d467a69-57ff-4ae7-96ee-b18c4790cffd&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Windows Resource Kit</a>.

The application installer, containing both x86 and x64 native executables, can be downloaded from <a href="/downloads/rfcfe/rfcfe.1.1.installer.exe">here</a>.

The source code for VS 2010 is available at <a href="https://github.com/almir/rfcfe" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

MD5 checksums for the installer can be found <a href="/downloads/rfcfe/md5sums.txt" target="_blank">here</a> and the changelogÂ <a href="/downloads/rfcfe/changelog.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.

For any suggestions and bug reports please <a href="https://github.com/almir/rfcfe/issues/new" target="_blank">create an issue on GitHub</a>.
